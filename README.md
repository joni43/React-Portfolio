# Version 1 - Jonathans First React Application

First release of my portfolio page. This was my very first react application, and itÂ´s a single page application. It was made during my time at KYH - Front End developer education. I call it version 1, because i am not nearly finish with this portfolio. 
I will most likely in the near future change design and make it more proffesional.


## Libraries
Im using react libraries, which you can see in package.json file.

### styled-components
Most of my styling is made with Styled componets. It lets you write actual CSS in your JavaScript, it is one of the hottest libraries to use forhandling styling using CSS-in-JS. 

## API

At the bottom of the page i am displaying image which i have fetch from NASA API, reason why is because it was one of the requirement in this course, to fetch API. And i choosed to fetch NASA images.
